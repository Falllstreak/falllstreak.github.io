    <h1>Final Project Part 2 - 1</h1>
    <ol>
      <li><b> What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</b>
        <ul>
          <li> My previous knowledge of the topics learned this quarter include basic HTML and inline CSS. I started HTML when HTML5 had just recently been released. The class I was in was the first to make the switch to HTML5. This course is my first time
            learning any JavaScript. </ul>
        <li> <b>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</b>
          <ul>
            <li> My portfolio was built upon Module 4's liquid layout. </ul>
          <li><b> What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template,
            artifacts, CSS, etc.)</b>
            <ul>
              <li> The most challenging part of my portfolio was actually the passing the accessibility checker. I saved those changes for last and it ended up being very time consuming. So for the future I know to make the site accessible while building it, not after.  </ul>
            <li> <b>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development?</b>
              <ul>
                <li> This class certainly opened my eyes to how interactive JavaScript is, and how it's used. Now whenever I visit any site I'm wondering exactly how things work and how much of it I already know how to do.
              </ul>
              <li> <b>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</b>
                <ul>
                  <li> Engage in Slack! Ask and answer questions. You'll find that the perspectives of other students are valuable when you hit any course roadblocks. Along with that don't forget to use the search bar in Slack. Even if one of your classmates
                    hasn't answered a question you have it's possible that a previous student already did.
                </ul>
    </ol>
