      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <section>Thanks for visiting. I'm Edwin Pacheco, and I'm the creator of this site. I am currently in my first quarter
        <br>of pursuing a Software Development degree, which started in the winter of 2023. After taking a break,
        <br> I've returned ready to complete my education and pursue a career that I'm passionate about.
        <br>Currently, I work as a Search Quality Evaluator, where I provide feedback on our search engines.
        <br> My goal in that work is to ensure that people can find exactly what they're intending on the internet.

        <h2>Personal Life</h2> A little about me outside of work or school. I'm a bit new to Washington, having moved from Florida within the last year. With that move came the discovery that I love to hike. The land here is so much varied with it's views, hills and mountains
        all over. I also learned that I have wanderlust. The experience of seeing something new, with my own eyes, has been something that I didn't realize I needed.
        <br>
        <br> I enjoy entertainment of all kinds. I spend my time watching films I've never seen and listening to music I've never heard. I dabble in creating music and in photography. I would recommend checking out my slideshow on the Artifacts page if you
        want to get an idea for my photography style.
