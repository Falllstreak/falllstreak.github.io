      <h2>The Film List</h2>
      <hr>
      <p class="filmlist">Over the years, I made a conscious effort to catch up on movies that I had missed out on or that had been highly recommended to me. Around 2015, I began watching a new film about every other day. As the number of movies I watched grew quickly, I
        realized that I was starting to forget some of their titles. To keep track of it all, I decided to create a <a href="https://boxd.it/4ErzY" target="_blank">list</a>.
        <br>

        <br> What started out as a simple way to remember titles quickly turned into a satisfying hobby of compiling a comprehensive list and discovering what made each film special to me. Below are three films from my list that I highly recommend:

        <br>
        <br> &#x2022; Mandy (2018): This is currently my favorite film. Starring Nicolas Cage you would expect this to be an over-the-top movie that's a fun ride, but not much else. It's a lot more. Directed by Panos Cosmatos, this psychedelic horror film
        carries with it a visual treat for the eyes, a heartbreaking story, and an unforgettable and otherworldy soundtrack.

        <br>
        <br>&#x2022; The Lighthouse (2019): This movie, directed by Robert Eggers, has aged incredibly well. It released just before Covid became a reality. It's a story about isolation from the outside world. The characters begin to unravel as the isolation
        becomes to much to bear. This unsettling film includes a cosmic horror tone unlike anything else.

        <br>
        <br>&#x2022; She Dies Tomorrow (2020): This film is directed by Amy Seimetz. If you couldn't tell by now I enjoy strange and visually striking movies. This particular movie is extremely strange. The story focuses on paranoia becoming contageous. What
        would you do if you believed that tomorrow would be the end?</p>
